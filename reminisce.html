        <p>My work consists of four distinct experiments, each designed to showcase progression as an element of beauty. These experiments allow individuals to perceive and reflect on this progression as something meaningful and worth reminiscing about.

            <p>This project is considered high-risk due to the lack of user testing and user journey mapping. It also carries a philosophical aspect, as it explores the concept of reminiscing from a unique perspective."

            <p>People often associate 'reminisce' with melancholy, sadness, or the past. However, in my view, reminiscing can happen anywhere, at any time, or at any hour. While working on this project, I encountered a challenge in week 10 when creating a video UI specifically for my glasses.

            <p><b>My Perspective on Reminiscing.</b>
                Merely reflecting on the process of creating this experimental design is, in itself, an act of reminiscing. The feelings, emotions, and intensity I experienced during the project—the pressure, the goals, and even the moments of being blindsided—were all part of that journey. In those moments, I temporarily lost sight of the fact that the experiment I was conducting was, from the very beginning, already a fundamental part of what makes Reminisce what it is. The process itself is Reminisce.   
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="r2-paragraph-exp">
            <p>In conclusion, this project bridged the past with the present through a series of experiments that reflected my personal journey of self-discovery, speculative design, and reflection. Despite the risks posed by the lack of user testing and journey mapping, I embraced the challenge and learned quickly, creating a character and environment in just two weeks with minimal knowledge of 3D software. While people often associate reminiscence with sadness and the past, I view it as something that can occur at any time, anywhere. The emotional intensity I experienced throughout this project became a form of reminiscence in itself, as I realized that the very process of creating this experimental design was a reflection of the concept I sought to explore. Ultimately, this project taught me that the act of reminiscence is not just about looking back, but about understanding how those moments shape who we are in the present.
